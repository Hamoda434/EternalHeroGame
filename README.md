# EternalHeroGame
# Directions on how to open game:
# 1) Download this repository
# 2) Click EternalHeroGame --> EternalHero --> Game
# 3) The game should run on Windows (it's a Windows export). If you run Game and it's just saying it can't find a file, let me know.
# (If you need a Mac/Linux version, let me know and I can add that in the folder as well.)
